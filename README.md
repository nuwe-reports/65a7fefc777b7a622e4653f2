This is my solution to Accenture's java challenge!

In Appointment Controller.java, I've done the "create Appointment" method regarding what was specified on related unit tests.

I've tested entities that hadn't being tested yet at EntityUnitTest.java and EntityControllerUnitTest.java.

The code was cleaned up and then documentated via UML diagram.

Lastly, Dockerfile.mysql and Dockerfile.maven archives were created in order to use Kubernetes when deploying.
